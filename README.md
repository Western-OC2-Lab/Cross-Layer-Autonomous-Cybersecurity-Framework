# Cross-Layer-Autonomous-Cybersecurity-Framework
This repository includes code for the paper "Towards Zero Touch Networks: Cross-Layer Automated Security Solutions for 6G Wireless Networks" submitted to IEEE TCOM, focusing on autonomous cybersecurity (physical-layer authentication and cross-layer intrusion detection) using AutoML techniques.

The paper is publicly available on TechRxiv: [Towards Zero Touch Networks: Cross-Layer Automated Security Solutions for 6G Wireless Networks](https://d197for5662m48.cloudfront.net/documents/publicationstatus/171667/preprint_pdf/557ec6745a4fe6fabc76c5e4d764d602.pdf)

The code will be shared soon after acceptance.
